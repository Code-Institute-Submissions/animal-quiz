# *Animal Trivia Quiz* - Milestone Project 2 for Code Institute

<hr>

The Animal Trivia Quiz was created using the skills learned during the first seven modules of the Full Stack Web Development course. The goal of this project was to create a mobile-first fully responsive quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This quiz is designed to entertain users while also teaching them some random facts about our co-inhabitants of the world. The layout of the quiz is meant to be minimalistic, making it easy to follow along and see results.
